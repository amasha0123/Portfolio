    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am an undergraduate student currently pursuing a BSc (Hons) in Software Engineering at NSBM Green University. After completing my school education, I gained valuable professional experience by working as a Bank Trainee, where I developed strong skills in teamwork, communication, responsibility, and time management.

I am highly motivated to build a career in the technology and software development field, with a strong interest in web and application development. I enjoy learning new technologies, solving problems, and applying theoretical knowledge to real-world projects. Through my academic journey and self-learning, I am continuously improving my technical and practical skills.

I am eager to grow as a software engineer and contribute to innovative projects while gaining industry experience.</p>
